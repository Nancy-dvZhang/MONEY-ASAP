## Welcome to Your Salary Estimator!

Wanna lead a perfect life? ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘

---

As a group of aspiring data scientists, we are highly interested and motivated to embark on our career in tech companies. Before seeking a full-time job, we want to learn more about the salaries from different companies. While some of us have started on our internships already, the rest would like to also navigate the status quo of data science and STEM career options as possible alternative plans. We would also like to know how the representativeness of certain socioeconomic groups affect their salary negotiation, and whether our project could help with uncovering the transparency lacking in this dynamic.

### Purpose

We would like to explore more about income and realise our own placements within the data. Specifically, we will be analyzing factors that would lead us to earn $100k/yr upon graduation.

Our preferred features include: company, level, title, education level and some other personal backgrounds.

### Data

We used [Kaggle Data Science and STEM income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries) for our analysis. This is a dataset scraped from the website of levels.fyi, a site with a visualised, crowdsourced database for transparent leveling charts across companies to help with job negotiation and possibly prevent underpaying for those underrepresented within tech industry.
